First, everybody gets in a circle, facing inside. Someone starts, and passes energy randomly across the circle, with the pattern \"Zip, Zap, Zup\" saying the words one at a time. The first player passes \"Zip\" across the circle to someone, then that person passes \"Zap\" to someone else, and then that player passes \"Zup\" to someone, who starts the pattern all over again.</p>\n\n<p>Make eye contact, and be clear and direct when you pass the energy. Make sure there can be no confusion about what your intentions are. Point your finger and enunciate loudly and clearly. If you aren't clear about who you are passing to, or what syllable you have passed, it could lead to confusion about what happens next. Every player in this game is a link in a chain - don't be the link that breaks the chain.</p>\n\n<p>You can do whatever you want when someone messes up (either by missing the pattern, saying the wrong word, taking too long, or thinking they have the pattern when they don't). Most people simply eliminate everyone until only two people are left. This isn't very fun, though, because nobody likes to feel like they failed a warmup exercise. An alternative is to make the people who have little accidents switch to a different pattern. For example, while everybody stays on \"Zip Zap Zup\" the person who missed their turn will be on \"Kip, Kap, Kup\" instead, so the pattern might go, \"Zip, Kap, Zup, Zip, Zap, Kup\" and so-on. If they mess up \"Kip Kap Kup,\" they can switch to \"Tip, Tap, Tup,\" or \"Wip, Wap, Wup,\" or whatever else you want.</p>\n\n<p>Start the pattern slowly enough for everybody to get into it. Let the players, especially if they've never played before, get used to the pattern and with passing energy across the circle. As you get more into it, increase the speed and intensity. See how quickly and smoothly you can fire off the pattern. Missing the pattern doesn't mean you failed, it just means you get to have a new way to play.</p>","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","modifiedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","__v":0,"duration":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf809ce","playerCount":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf809be","dateModified":"2017-03-21T20:59:13.256Z","dateAdded":"2016-11-28T16:00:25.302Z","tags":[{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf80a48","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d19421c60aaf499cf80ec2","dateAdded":"2016-11-28T16:00:50.007Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf809ef","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d19421c60aaf499cf80ec3","dateAdded":"2016-11-28T16:00:57.467Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf80a15","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d19421c60aaf499cf80ec4","dateAdded":"2016-11-28T16:01:02.461Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf80a06","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d19421c60aaf499cf80ec5","dateAdded":"2017-01-25T16:47:46.181Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf80a30","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d19421c60aaf499cf80ec6","dateAdded":"2017-01-25T16:53:17.126Z"}],"notes":[],"names":["58d19421c60aaf499cf80ec7","58d19421c60aaf499cf80ec8","58d19421c60aaf499cf80ec9"]},{"_id":"58d19420c60aaf499cf80cf1","legacyID":116,"description":"One player (\"it\") stands against a wall (no, you aren't in trouble).

Square should establish what Circle is doing, who they are, what their relationship is, and why they are doing what they are doing.

Be the hero the team needs, not the one they deserve - or something like that.","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","modifiedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","__v":0,"duration":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf809d0","playerCount":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf809bc","dateModified":"2017-03-21T20:59:11.897Z","dateAdded":"2014-12-16T10:11:35.872Z","tags":[{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf80a0a","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d1941fc60aaf499cf80cbc","dateAdded":"2014-12-16T10:11:35.875Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf80a0b","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d1941fc60aaf499cf80cbd","dateAdded":"2014-12-16T10:11:35.883Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf80a46","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d1941fc60aaf499cf80cbe","dateAdded":"2014-12-16T10:11:35.883Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf80a48","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d1941fc60aaf499cf80cbf","dateAdded":"2014-12-16T10:11:35.884Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf80a0c","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d1941fc60aaf499cf80cc0","dateAdded":"2014-12-16T10:11:35.885Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf80a0d","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d1941fc60aaf499cf80cc1","dateAdded":"2014-12-16T10:11:35.886Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf80a01","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d1941fc60aaf499cf80cc2","dateAdded":"2014-12-16T10:11:35.886Z"},{"tag":"59131af599df17002686a287","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"59131af599df17002686a288","dateAdded":"2017-05-10T13:51:49.749Z"}],"notes":[],"names":["58d1941fc60aaf499cf80cc3"]},{"_id":"58d1941fc60aaf499cf80caf","legacyID":101,"description":"Everybody gathers into a circular type arrangement (in that they get into a circle, which is about as circular as you can get).

It works best with four people (one guesser, and three weirdos).","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","modifiedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","__v":0,"duration":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf809ce","playerCount":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf809c4","dateModified":"2017-03-21T20:59:10.651Z","dateAdded":"2013-11-22T09:28:16.000Z","tags":[{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf80a47","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d1941ec60aaf499cf80b06","dateAdded":"2013-11-22T09:28:16.000Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf809e2","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d1941ec60aaf499cf80b07","dateAdded":"2013-11-22T09:28:16.000Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf809e0","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d1941ec60aaf499cf80b08","dateAdded":"2013-11-22T09:28:17.000Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf80a29","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"592601c760fb7b00262c1fa7","dateAdded":"2017-05-24T21:57:27.500Z"},{"tag":"5925c61c53869f0026a53292","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"592601cd60fb7b00262c1fa8","dateAdded":"2017-05-24T21:57:33.159Z"}],"notes":[],"names":["58d1941ec60aaf499cf80b09"]},{"_id":"58d19420c60aaf499cf80d1f","legacyID":126,"description":"Four players have to try to hide a fifth using only their bodies.

See how clearly and effectively you can establish your environment.","modifiedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","duration":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf809ce","playerCount":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf809ba","dateModified":"2017-04-25T21:23:28.535Z","dateAdded":"2017-04-25T13:32:53.595Z","tags":[{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf80a46","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58ff500f13ef9b003b7f2719","dateAdded":"2017-04-25T13:33:03.468Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf809dc","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58ff501313ef9b003b7f271a","dateAdded":"2017-04-25T13:33:07.409Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf809ff","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58ff502f13ef9b003b7f271b","dateAdded":"2017-04-25T13:33:35.461Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf809ea","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58ff503213ef9b003b7f271c","dateAdded":"2017-04-25T13:33:38.703Z"},{"tag":"58ff507a13ef9b003b7f271d","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58ff507a13ef9b003b7f271e","dateAdded":"2017-04-25T13:34:50.455Z"}],"notes":[],"names":["58ff500b13ef9b003b7f2718"]},{"_id":"58d1941ec60aaf499cf80b45","legacyID":38,"description":"Four players act out four scenes.

Each turn at the center should be a single verse, which is about eight measures of the song, I think. You'll get an idea if you listen to the song. As soon as one player has finished their piece, someone should jump up and sing a verse based on whatever sparks an idea from the verse before.

You can add some framework to the exercise by running multiple \"drills\" of the game, each time starting with the same opening line.","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","modifiedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","__v":0,"duration":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf809ce","playerCount":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf809ba","dateModified":"2017-03-21T20:59:10.187Z","dateAdded":"2016-02-02T20:10:37.783Z","tags":[{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf809d9","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d1941ec60aaf499cf80a79","dateAdded":"2017-02-19T00:47:40.732Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf80a46","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d1941ec60aaf499cf80a7a","dateAdded":"2016-09-12T18:19:01.745Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf809dc","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d1941ec60aaf499cf80a7b","dateAdded":"2016-09-12T18:19:03.304Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf80a07","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d1941ec60aaf499cf80a7c","dateAdded":"2016-09-12T18:19:13.077Z"},{"tag":"5925c61c53869f0026a53292","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"5926012760fb7b00262c1f9d","dateAdded":"2017-05-24T21:54:47.394Z"}],"notes":[],"names":["58d1941ec60aaf499cf80a7d","58d1941ec60aaf499cf80a7e"]},{"_id":"58d1941fc60aaf499cf80be3","legacyID":65,"description":"In this warmup game, the players form a circle and choose one player to be \"it.\" The \"it\" player then confronts the players in the circle and yells \"WHERE ARE YOU GOING\" .

It can be a great exercise for new Improvisers, but it can be just as beneficial for experienced players, too. It is very advantageous to have a whiteboard or other kind of large format notepad to write on that the whole group can see.</p>\n\n<p>Start by choosing a location. It can be any location, but you want to pick something relatively large or where you might find lots of different people. For example, a bathroom might not be the best location for this game, but something like Target or the break room would work well. You can also pick a location for the group, choosing something that everyone will be generally familiar with, to make sure you start with something strong.<p>\n\n<p>Next, have the participants brainstorm ideas for settings within that location, or details about the space itself. For example, a Target can include a seemingly infinite assortment of settings for scenes, from the pharmacy counter to the electronics section. A smaller location like a break room might not have quite as many, but there are still plenty of details to establish - what things might you find in a break room? Continue brainstorming ideas, collecting fifteen or twenty options if necessary. Keep going until you exhaust all the \"obvious\" ideas and you have to start coming up with really creative stuff (The dumpster behind the Target? The \"equal opportunity employer\" poster in the break room?)</p>\n\n<p>With the settings established, now you can brainstorm ideas for people you might find in the location. Again, some locations will have more obvious options than others, but you should keep coming up with ideas until you are forced to really stretch your creativity and come up with some really fun ideas.</p>\n\n<p>Now that you have a good list of locations and characters based on the suggestion, have two participants step forward. Ask them to select a location from your list and a character, and then begin a scene as that character in that location (or otherwise based on the environmental detail). After a few moments, pause the scene and see if the audience can tell where and who the players are. Let the players know that they need to be prepared to let go of their location if their scene partner establishes theirs first (if your partner talks about the dumpster out back, it doesn't matter what your idea was - you're at the dumpster out back now). Ask players to think about how their character feels about their scene partner's character, and how they feel about the location or environment they are in.</p>\n\n<p>This is a good way to practice how you can establish the details of a scene quickly so that everyone is on the same page. It also helps new players get an idea for the thought process around how to handle a suggestion, and how to turn that into a scene. You can also also practice developing simple archetypes into characters.</p>","dateModified":"2017-05-04T20:06:09.863Z","dateAdded":"2017-05-04T19:48:23.520Z","tags":[{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf80a46","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"590b85c1b9fb12003b46d7e9","dateAdded":"2017-05-04T19:49:21.830Z"},{"tag":"58ff507a13ef9b003b7f271d","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"590b85c7b9fb12003b46d7ea","dateAdded":"2017-05-04T19:49:27.882Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf809dc","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"590b85d1b9fb12003b46d7eb","dateAdded":"2017-05-04T19:49:37.702Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf809e2","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"590b85d4b9fb12003b46d7ec","dateAdded":"2017-05-04T19:49:40.565Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf809d9","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"590b85d8b9fb12003b46d7ed","dateAdded":"2017-05-04T19:49:44.893Z"}],"notes":[],"names":["590b858db9fb12003b46d7e8"]},{"_id":"58d19421c60aaf499cf80e65","legacyID":159,"description":"Get in one of those big group circles.

Start with two or three players. If using three, consider tagging one of them to start the scene off-stage. Before the scene begins, each player should (secretly in their own heads) pick a number between one and the number of players. If two players pick the same number, that's fine. This number informs the player of their \"status\" in the scene. One is the lowest status, and two or three (or however many players there are) is the highest. Obviously, you can reverse that and make one the highest - just as long as everybody agrees as to what is \"high\" and what is \"low.\" With the numbers established (secretly, of course), the players then do a normal scene, with that number informing their character's status in the scene.</p>\n\n<p>This can be a challenging exercise, because it can prove difficult to drive a \"good\" scene and keep your status in mind. It can be helpful to pause the scene at some point and ask the audience (if this is during a practice or exercise) what they think each character's number is - this can help the players get an idea of how well they are conveying their status. You'll have more fun if you fully commit to your status. It can get really crazy (in a good way) if two players are \"competing\" over the same status, trying to outdo each other in being the lowest, highest, or most middlest status possible.</p>\n\n<p>Another technique you can use is to have each player draw a playing card and hold it to their forehead. This informs everybody else in the scene what everyone's status is, but each player doesn't know themselves. See how quickly and accurately you can figure out what your status is. If the old forehead thing is a little too silly, just draw a card and let it establish your status or your partner's status.</p>","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","modifiedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","__v":0,"duration":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf809ce","playerCount":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf809bd","dateModified":"2017-03-21T20:59:13.206Z","dateAdded":"2016-10-05T14:28:25.948Z","tags":[{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf809dc","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d19421c60aaf499cf80ead","dateAdded":"2016-10-05T14:28:25.958Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf80a31","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d19421c60aaf499cf80eae","dateAdded":"2016-10-05T14:28:25.967Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf80a46","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d19421c60aaf499cf80eaf","dateAdded":"2016-10-05T14:28:25.971Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf809e2","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d19421c60aaf499cf80eb0","dateAdded":"2016-10-05T14:28:25.972Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf80a40","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d19421c60aaf499cf80eb1","dateAdded":"2016-10-05T14:28:25.974Z"}],"notes":[],"names":["58d19421c60aaf499cf80eb2"]},{"_id":"58d19421c60aaf499cf80e9a","legacyID":60,"description":"<p>Everybody stands in a circle, with one player in the middle. This player in the middle, we'll call them \"It,\" randomly steps up to players in the circle and throws challenges at them (we'll call the challenged player \"At\"). Any time a player slips up and does something they aren't supposed to, \"It\" takes their place, and they become the new \"It.\"</p>\n\n<p>The first challenge is for \"It\" to simply yell <strong>\"Bibbity Bibbity Bop!\"</strong> When this happens, the goal is for \"At\" to say \"Bop\" before \"It\" does.</p>\n\n<p>With that mastered, increase the challenge by adding <strong>\"Miggity Miggity Mack.\"</strong> When \"It\" says this, the goal is for \"At\" to say nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Once you get the hang of all that, you can throw in the fun ones. For these, \"It\" will yell a word at \"At\" and then count to 10 as quickly as possible. Before \"It\" reaches ten, \"At\" and the player on each side of \"At\" have to build whatever thing \"It\" yelled. Agree on the words and forms that you will use ahead of time. There's no limit to what things you can use, so you can mix it up to keep people on their toes. There are some old standards which you can use or take inspiration from.</p>\n\n<p>The first is <strong>\"Elephant.\"</strong> When \"Elephant\" is called, \"At\" forms a trunk by holding one hand on their nose and sticking their other arm out in front (making an elephant noise is highly encouraged). The player to the left of \"At\" forms the left ear by holding her arms up to \"At's\" head (like you're three-fourths of the way through the YMCA song). The player on the right of \"At\" forms the right ear in the same way.</p>\n\n<p>For <strong>\"Toaster\"</strong> the two players on either side of \"At\" hold their arms together, forming a \"slot\" for \"At\" to pop out of like a piece of toast. I don't know what kind of sound toast makes, but feel free to figure that out.</p>\n\n<p>Another fun one would be <strong>\"Flamingos.\"</strong> For this one, the three players (\"At\" and the player on either side of her) all pretend to be a flock of flamingoes. This is pretty simple, you just hold your hands under your arms (as if you felt like chicken tonight) and stand with one foot on your other knee (this is a thing flamingoes do a lot, because they don't have anything better to do).</p>\n\n<p>Yet another option is <strong>\"Star Wars.\"</strong> For this the three players will form the classic image on the original Star Wars poster. \"At\" becomes Luke, and holds his \"copyright non-infringing generic laser sword\" up in the air over his head. The player on the right becomes Han, and stands with his back to \"At\" holding a \"unspecified handheld shoot blaster\" at the ready. Finally, the player on the left becomes Leia, and kneels at Luke's feet in that awkward, subservient sort of pose that we never talk about. As a reminder, remember that <em>Left</em> is <em>Leia</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Use any combination of these things, or come up with your own challenges. Start with just one or two options, and add more as you master them. The point is to keep people on their feet, reacting quickly, and working together.

In this, the group stands in a circle and passes energy around from one player to the next. The nature of the passing really depends on you, as long as all of the players are on the same page. This description will outline the basic idea with some made up sounds that you can feel free to use or replace with whatever sounds you want. This description doesn't care.</p>\n\n<p>The basic way to pass the energy is directly to the next person in the circle by waving your arms and saying \"whoosh.\" The energy is thereby for the most part passed in one direction around the circle from one player to the next. Easy Peasy.</p>\n\n<p>Except! At any time a player can hold up a hand to the energy and say \"switch!\" When this happens, the direction is reversed, and it goes back the other way. The person who was \"switch'd\" can then \"whoosh\" on back the other direction. You can also \"switch\" a \"switch\" if you are that kind of person.</p>\n\n<p>Also! You can point to a person across the circle and say \"zoom\" at them. Now the energy is passed to them. They can then \"whoosh\" in the same direction it was heading before (unless that's too complicated for you, in which case just whoosh whichever way). I don't think it makes sense to \"switch\" a \"zoom\" so just don't do that. You can \"zoom\" a \"switch,\" though, but you can't tune a fish - er...</p>\n\n<p>Concordantly! You can also say \"pow\" in the direction of the energy flow, moving your arms over the head of the person next to you as if you were throwing a classic hook shot from such basketballs. When you do this, the energy skips the next person and goes to the person after that. It then continues on like normal. If a person gets \"pow'd\" they can \"switch\" which would send it to the person who was skipped, if that makes any sense at all.</p>\n\n<p>And lo! Feel free to add any manner of other things, giving them a distinct sound and gesture. You can make a thing send the energy behind you, so you face one person but the energy goes the opposite direction. You can make a thing that makes everybody in the circle do and / or say something. Go crazy!</p>\n\n<p>The idea is to just get into a pattern, getting used to making quick decisions within a set structure and being okay with screwing up (because there are no consequences). Feel free to start with one or just a couple things and work your way up as the players get used to them.</p>","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","modifiedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07e01","__v":0,"duration":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf809ce","playerCount":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf809bc","dateModified":"2017-05-24T16:27:41.686Z","dateAdded":"2016-02-01T20:51:44.402Z","tags":[{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf80a48","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d19420c60aaf499cf80d91","dateAdded":"2016-09-12T18:42:16.533Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf809ef","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d19420c60aaf499cf80d92","dateAdded":"2016-09-12T18:42:18.025Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf80a15","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d19420c60aaf499cf80d93","dateAdded":"2016-09-12T18:42:19.442Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf809f0","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07e01","_id":"5925b4791d04460026a7551e","dateAdded":"2017-05-24T16:27:37.121Z"}],"notes":[],"names":["58d19420c60aaf499cf80d94"]},{"_id":"58d19421c60aaf499cf80eb8","legacyID":96,"description":"<p>Gather the group into a circle. One at a time, starting anywhere in the circle and continuing clockwise, each player will introduce themselves by saying their name (first names are fine) and doing a gesture of some sort. The gesture doesn't have to be anything specific or make any sense. You could do a jumping jack, salute, or abstractly wave your arms about - it doesn't matter. The point is to just get on your feet and do a thing. After each player demonstrates their name and gesture, the entire group repeats it in unison. Try your best to replicate the gesture as closely as the person who created it.</p>\n\n<p>After everyone has had a chance to give their gesture, inform the group that you are going to raise the stakes. Consider your level of commitment and enthusiasm a \"1\" and go through the process again, raising it to a \"10.\" Starting with the first player again and repeat the process with the same names and gestures. Each player demonstrates their name and gesture, this time increasing the intensity all the way to 10. The group repeats it in unison, copying that level of intensity. What does it feel like to commit more fully to an action? How does your gesture evolve? Does it go from a simple hop to a giant leap? Does a simple salute become a full-body exercise?</p>\n\n<p>After doing all of the gestures again, repeat the process a third time. Consider this new level of commitment a \"1\" and extrapolate that all the way to \"10.\" How can you make your gesture that much more intense?</p>\n\n<p>Now endeavor to do everything with that level of commitment and enthusiasm. Why not just start at maximum intensity?</p>\n\n<p><em>You can apply two modifications to this game. First, instead of having the entire group repeat each gesture in unison, have each player repeat all of the names and gestures of every player that came before them. Yes, this means that the last player in the circle will be doing everybody's gesture. Also, instead of just doing one gesture, you can have each player do a different gesture for each syllable in their name. For example, if my name was \"Alyson,\" I would do a gesture for \"al,\" a gesture for \"ih,\" and a gesture for \"son.\"</em></p>","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","modifiedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","__v":0,"duration":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf809ce","playerCount":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf809bc","dateModified":"2017-03-21T20:59:13.235Z","dateAdded":"2014-12-14T19:04:53.958Z","tags":[{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf80a48","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d19421c60aaf499cf80eb9","dateAdded":"2014-12-14T19:04:53.979Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf80a06","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d19421c60aaf499cf80eba","dateAdded":"2014-12-14T19:04:53.981Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf80a02","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d19421c60aaf499cf80ebb","dateAdded":"2014-12-14T19:04:53.982Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf80a44","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d19421c60aaf499cf80ebc","dateAdded":"2017-01-25T16:46:41.850Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf809f0","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d19421c60aaf499cf80ebd","dateAdded":"2017-01-25T16:46:47.376Z"},{"tag":"58d1941dc60aaf499cf80a3e","addedUser":"58c6e5bcd036281f4ce07dff","_id":"58d19421c60aaf499cf80ebe","dateAdded":"2017-01-25T16:46:51.885Z"}],"notes":[],"names":["58d19421c60aaf499cf80ebf","58d19421c60aaf499cf80ec0"]},{"_id":"58d1941ec60aaf499cf80a5c","legacyID":185,"description":"<p>Players stand in a circle, or generally face each other (the shape isn't really important in this one).
