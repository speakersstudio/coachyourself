The product can be any mundane household item, but it has some exciting new feature or quality that makes it noteworthy (for example, a spatula with wheels, or something). The group must come up with a name, a package design, a slogan, a spokesperson, and a jingle in order to create a cohesive ad campaign for the product. The group needs to be in complete agreement with each idea, since you have to come up with so many in so little time. Each idea offered by someone in the group should be met with shouts of approval and excitement.</p>\n\n<p>Usually one player will assume the role of the \"boss\" of the group, leading them through the process like a senior ad executive leading his team. This game is a great way to practice saying \"yes\" to every idea and seeing how that can lead in crazy directions.</p>",

The nature of the passing really depends on you, as long as all of the players are on the same page. This description will outline the basic idea with some made up sounds that you can feel free to use or replace with whatever sounds you want. This description doesn't care.</p>\n\n<p>The basic way to pass the energy is directly to the next person in the circle by waving your arms and saying \"whoosh.\" The energy is thereby for the most part passed in one direction around the circle from one player to the next. Easy Peasy.</p>\n\n<p>Except! At any time a player can hold up a hand to the energy and say \"switch!\" When this happens, the direction is reversed, and it goes back the other way. The person who was \"switch'd\" can then \"whoosh\" on back the other direction. You can also \"switch\" a \"switch\" if you are that kind of person.</p>\n\n<p>Also! You can point to a person across the circle and say \"zoom\" at them. Now the energy is passed to them. They can then \"whoosh\" in the same direction it was heading before (unless that's too complicated for you, in which case just whoosh whichever way). I don't think it makes sense to \"switch\" a \"zoom\" so just don't do that. You can \"zoom\" a \"switch,\" though, but you can't tune a fish - er...</p>\n\n<p>Concordantly! You can also say \"pow\" in the direction of the energy flow, moving your arms over the head of the person next to you as if you were throwing a classic hook shot from such basketballs. When you do this, the energy skips the next person and goes to the person after that. It then continues on like normal. If a person gets \"pow'd\" they can \"switch\" which would send it to the person who was skipped, if that makes any sense at all.</p>\n\n<p>And lo! Feel free to add any manor of other things, giving them a distinct sound and gesture. You can make a thing send the energy behind you, so you face one person but the energy goes the opposite direction. You can make a thing that makes everybody in the circle do and / or say something. Go crazy!</p>\n\n<p>The idea is to just get into a pattern, getting used to making quick decisions within a set structure and being okay with screwing up (because there are no consequences). Feel free to start with one or just a couple things and work your way up as the players get used to them.</p>",

The player to the left of \"At\" forms the left ear by holding her arms up to \"At's\" head (like you're three-fourths of the way through the YMCA song). The player on the right of \"At\" forms the right ear in the same way.</p>\n\n<p>For <strong>\"Toaster\"</strong> the two players on either side of \"At\" hold their arms together, forming a \"slot\" for \"At\" to pop out of like a piece of toast. I don't know what kind of sound toast makes, but feel free to figure that out.</p>\n\n<p>Another fun one would be <strong>\"Flamingos.\"</strong> For this one, the three players (\"At\" and the player on either side of her) all pretend to be a flock of flamingoes. This is pretty simple, you just hold your hands under your arms (as if you felt like chicken tonight) and stand with one foot on your other knee (this is a thing flamingoes do a lot, because they don't have anything better to do).</p>\n\n<p>Yet another option is <strong>\"Star Wars.\"</strong> For this the three players will form the classic image on the original Star Wars poster. \"At\" becomes Luke, and holds his \"copyright non-infringing generic laser sword\" up in the air over his head. The player on the right becomes Han, and stands with his back to \"At\" holding a \"unspecified handheld shoot blaster\" at the ready. Finally, the player on the left becomes Leia, and kneels at Luke's feet in that awkward, subservient sort of pose that we never talk about. As a reminder, remember that <em>Left</em> is <em>Leia</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Use any combination of these things, or come up with your own challenges.

If using three, consider tagging one of them to start the scene off-stage.

This number informs the player of their \"status\" in the scene. One is the lowest status, and two or three (or however many players there are) is the highest. Obviously, you can reverse that and make one the highest - just as long as everybody agrees as to what is \"high\" and what is \"low.\" With the numbers established (secretly, of course), the players then do a normal scene, with that number informing their character's status in the scene.</p>\n\n<p>This can be a challenging exercise, because it can prove difficult to drive a \"good\" scene and keep your status in mind. It can be helpful to pause the scene at some point and ask the audience (if this is during a practice or exercise) what they think each character's number is - this can help the players get an idea of how well they are conveying their status. You'll have more fun if you fully commit to your status. It can get really crazy (in a good way) if two players are \"competing\" over the same status, trying to outdo each other in being the lowest, highest, or most middlest status possible.</p>\n\n<p>Another technique you can use is to have each player draw a playing card and hold it to their forehead. This informs everybody else in the scene what everyone's status is, but each player doesn't know themselves. See how quickly and accurately you can figure out what your status is.

Why not just start at maximum intensity?</p>\n\n<p><em>You can apply two modifications to this game. First, instead of having the entire group repeat each gesture in unison, have each player repeat all of the names and gestures of every player that came before them. Yes, this means that the last player in the circle will be doing everybody's gesture. Also, instead of just doing one gesture, you can have each player do a different gesture for each syllable in their name. For example, if my name was \"Alyson,\" I would do a gesture for \"al,\" a gesture for \"ih,\" and a gesture for \"son.\"</em></p>",

    "description": "<p>This is probably the most classic Improv warmup exercise. First, everybody gets in a circle, facing inside. Someone starts, and passes energy randomly across the circle, with the pattern \"Zip, Zap, Zup\" saying the words one at a time. The first player passes \"Zip\" across the circle to someone, then that person passes \"Zap\" to someone else, and then that player passes \"Zup\" to someone, who starts the pattern all over again.</p>\n\n<p>Make eye contact, and be clear and direct when you pass the energy. Make sure there can be no confusion about what your intentions are. Point your finger and enunciate loudly and clearly. If you aren't clear about who you are passing to, or what syllable you have passed, it could lead to confusion about what happens next. Every player in this game is a link in a chain - don't be the link that breaks the chain.</p>\n\n<p>You can do whatever you want when someone messes up (either by missing the pattern, saying the wrong word, taking too long, or thinking they have the pattern when they don't). Most people simply eliminate everyone until only two people are left. This isn't very fun, though, because nobody likes to feel like they failed a warmup exercise. An alternative is to make the people who have little accidents switch to a different pattern. For example, while everybody stays on \"Zip Zap Zup\" the person who missed their turn will be on \"Kip, Kap, Kup\" instead, so the pattern might go, \"Zip, Kap, Zup, Zip, Zap, Kup\" and so-on. If they mess up \"Kip Kap Kup,\" they can switch to \"Tip, Tap, Tup,\" or \"Wip, Wap, Wup,\" or whatever else you want.</p>\n\n<p>Start the pattern slowly enough for everybody to get into it. Let the players, especially if they've never played before, get used to the pattern and with passing energy across the circle. As you get more into it, increase the speed and intensity. See how quickly and smoothly you can fire off the pattern. Missing the pattern doesn't mean you failed, it just means you get to have a new way to play.</p>",

    "description": "<p>To start this warmup, everybody should get a quick rhythm going by tapping on their thighs or whatever. This isn't a rhythm to follow or anything, it's more of a steady drum roll to keep the energy up. You don't have to all be in a circle, but it probably makes sense.</p>\n\n<p>Somebody in the group starts by picking somebody at random and saying, \"hey [name of person]!\"</p>\n\n<p>That person might respond, \"what's up, [name of other person]?\" The banter doesn't really matter, just have fun with it.</p>\n\n<p>The first person then asks for five things of some category, like \"What are five things you could find in your shoe?\" or \"What are five things that can fly?\"</p>\n\n<p>The person then comes up with five things that fit the category. There are no right or wrong answers here, just say whatever. After each thing, the group will count them together, chanting \"One!\" and \"two!\" and so on until you get five things (hence the name of the game). After the last one, everybody says \"these are five things!\" The person who just listed things calls somebody else out, and prompts them with another category. Keep going until everybody has gone, saving the person who asked the first question for last.</p>",
