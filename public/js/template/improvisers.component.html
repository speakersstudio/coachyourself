            <p>What if there was a place for Improv?</p>

            <p>What if we could instantly connect with other Improvisers on a local, regional, national, and even global scale? What if we could utilize the power of modern technology to stop having to deal with the headaches of practicing and performing Improv? What if we could have an easy to use set of tools to help us promote what we do? What if we could easily connect our talents and knowledge with others in order to actually start making money doing what we love?</p>

            <p>Now we can. Welcome to <span class="light">improv</span><strong>plus</strong>.</p>

        <h4>the era of <strong>plus</strong> has begun</h4>

        <p>It turns out that computers are really good at a few things. Comedy? Not so much. Organizing and presenting sets of data? Connecting people with other people who have similar interests or motivations? Those things are kind of what computers were designed for (they can leave the comedy to us). We think it's time the Improv community took advantage of that - don't you?</p>
